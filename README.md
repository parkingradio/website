# Parking Radio

Parking Radio an independent non-profit radio whose goal is to promote underground artists and their
music, and to provide a professional grade diffusion platform for their performances.

This web app implements both the user-visible web site for the radio and also provides tools to administer
various aspects of the project, such as uploading sets, helping schedule upcoming diffusion sessions, etc.

## General Technological Choices and Deployment

The web app is implemented in full-stack Javascript talking to a PostgreSQL database. We produce a Docker
image that contains the server itself. In production, we have a Docker Compose stack that layers a Nginx
reverse proxy on top of the server container.

The Postgres database is hosted on Amazon RDS.

Deployment is done via Terraform.
